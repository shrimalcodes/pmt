The HCES is a consumption survey done PAN India. You can find all the data at the NDA website (https://microdata.gov.in/nada43/index.php/catalog/CEXP). I've used 2011 and 2022 data for the project in question <addlink>
The files however are all txt files with unrecognizable rows. To the best of my ability, I've simplified it so regressions and other econometric models can run on Stata (but, there's also a CSV). The HCES data collects
consumption data in levels depending on the catgory of consumption. It's reflected accordingly in the files. There's the do files that go adjacently that were used to clean the data, and the file
that is most interesting to this project is the Python Code. Find more about the research here:
